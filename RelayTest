// This sketch is for testing the relay output for the small version of the
// Arduino home automation shield (v3). 
// The relay is turned on for one second and then off for one second.
// The Arduino's onboard LED is also turned on/off along with the relays.
//
// There are no jumpers required for this version (v3) of the shield
//
// The onboard relay is limited to switching low voltage / low current circuits (e.g. low current LEDs for example)
// (typically your shield will have a maximum load of 100mA unless you have requested a more powerful relay).
// By special request, we may provide a more expensive relay that allows you to switch loads up to up to 400mA.



void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin (pin 3) as an output to switch the relay.
  // Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards:
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(3, HIGH);    // turn relay on
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // set the LED on
  
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second

  digitalWrite(3, LOW);    // turn relay off
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // set the LED off

  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
