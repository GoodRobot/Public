// This sketch is for testing the pushbutton on the smaller revised
// Arduino home automation shield (v3). 
// Whenever the pushbutton is pressed atop the shield this sketch 
// it lights the Arduino's onboard LED.
//
// There are no jumpers aboard this home automation shield 
// 
// CAUTION: do not turn pin 6 to an output pin while the shield is plugged in. Doing so could cause a short circuit to 
//          ground if you put the pin high and press the button.


void setup() {                
  // initialize Pin 6 as an input (this is what we use for button sensing).
  // Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards:
  pinMode(6, INPUT);     // this is the pin connected to our pushbutton
  digitalWrite(6, HIGH); // turn on pullup resistors (required, since there is no resistor to the button on the board)
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);   // this is the Arduino's built-in LED
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead (6) == HIGH) {   // check whether button is pushed or not
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);         // Button is not pushed, so keep the LED OFF
    Serial.println("Button is off");
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);        // Button is pushed, so turn the LED ON
    Serial.println("Button is on");
  };
